    "description": "Warm & Welcoming with Lots of Charm!\n\nI begun going to One Love One Heart yoga 4 years ago and I am addicted! There is such a great sense of community with a positive and encouraging environment from all. The teacher's provide such a unique and wonderful practice. They have tons of experience and really leave you feeling incredible by the time you leave. They are all excellent at helping you learn yoga, develop your practice, as well as help modify positions if they are too challenging. This yoga is for all different levels and ages. I've been to many different studios, but this hidden gem in Beeton has really changed my life. Thank you to everyone at One Love One Heart yoga.",

I had a good experience and would like to return but the cost is pretty steep once you sign up after that promo unlimited package is done.",

Very professional and I felt that I was safe and she knew how to help my previous health issues. On exiting I noticed how nice the yoga atmosphere was, I liked how quiet and tranquil it was. Some yoga studios can be loud but this one was very relaxing. Overall great experience will go again and try the yoga which looked well priced.",
